# 🌦 Weather Data Analysis with Python

This project presents a comprehensive analysis of hourly weather data from the year 2012. The dataset includes information on temperature, wind speed, humidity, visibility, pressure, and descriptive weather conditions collected over time. The analysis is performed using Python libraries such as **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**.

---

## 📌 Objectives

- Understand the structure and distribution of weather data
- Perform detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Derive insights on temperature trends, wind speed, visibility, and humidity
- Identify patterns based on seasons, time of day, and weather events
- Visualize the results effectively using plots and charts

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language for data processing and analysis  
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and transformation  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For creating informative visualizations

## 📊 Key Analyses Performed

- Dataset overview: structure, missing values, and data types
- Unique and frequent weather conditions
- Average temperature by hour, month, and season
- Sub-zero temperature events and fog frequency by month
- Day vs Night temperature comparison
- Visibility distribution under different weather types
- Correlation analysis using heatmaps
- Wind speed analysis by part of day and month
- Detection of rapid wind changes and extreme weather transitions

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used in this project was provided as a CSV file titled:

*Project+1+-+Weather+Dataset.csv*


It contains hourly weather records for the year 2012.

## 📷 Visuals Included

- Line plot of temperature over time  
- Bar charts of average temperature, wind speed, and visibility  
- Violin and histogram plots for distribution analysis  
- Heatmap of feature correlations  
- Seasonal and hourly trends  

---

## ✅ Results

This project successfully identifies important weather trends and variations, such as:
- Colder months having more sub-zero events  
- Morning hours generally having lower temperatures  
- Wind speeds and humidity levels varying with time of day and condition  
- Distinct weather transitions and visibility patterns  

---

## 📌 Future Work

- Build a weather forecasting model using machine learning  
- Detect anomalies or unusual patterns  
- Compare across multiple years or cities
